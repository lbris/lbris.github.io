		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>As a final to the AP Computer Science year I completed a project that replicates the game of Zombie Dice. It challenged me with random number generation, many loops, arrays and objects. As my project in Independent Study Programming IV, I took it upon myself to learn PYTHON.</p>
		<h2>Standardized Tests</h2>
		<p>When taking the SAT test in October, 2017, I received a score of 1340, 640 in the Reading and Writing category, and 700 in the Math. On the Advanced Placement tests I got a 3 in Statistics and a 3 in Computer Science.</p>
		<h2>Teaching a Church Class</h2>
		<p>At Harvest Community Church, I helped teach a group of children about the bible as an assistant teacher. </p>
