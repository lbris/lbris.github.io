		<h2>Zombie Dice</h2>
		<p>As a final to the AP Computer Science year I completed a project that replicates the game of Zombie Dice. This program showed my skills working with JAVA and how well I could organize the coding behind it. It challenged me with random number generation, many loops, arrays and objects. I ended up receiving an 'A' on the project and a better understanding of the language.</p>
		<h2>Current Projects</h2>
		<p>In Computer Programming IV, I have completed a handful of very challenging programs, including a Bingo game that exports and imports cards from text files, a perfect card shuffling program that can both in-shuffle and out-shuffle, and a program that records statistics, transforms that data to averages and point values, and stores it in a text file. All of these programs have further advanced my knowledge of programming, and have given me a chance to show the extent of what I am really capable.</p>
		<h2>1340 SAT</h2>
		<p>When taking the SAT test in October, 2017, I received a score of 1340, 640 in the Reading and Writing category, and 700 in the Math. This high of a number shows how intellectually capable and hardworking I am in school, and shows I am able to solve problems and retain information relatively quickly. Scores like this one are very crucial to the college application process, as well as applying for scholarships. A nice grade determines acceptance or declination, and my ability to succeed.</p>
		<h2>Teaching a Church Class</h2>
		<p>At Harvest Community Church, in Kittanning, PA, I help teach a group of children about the bible as an assistant teacher. This experience shows how I am able to express ideas to others in ways they could understand. I am also able to take the role as a leader to the kids and lead them to a better life.</p>
