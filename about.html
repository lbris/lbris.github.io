		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>My name is Luke, I am currently enrolled as a Freshman Computer Science major at Slippery Rock University. I live on campus, and am in the Honors College.</p>
		<p>I really enjoy playing soccer, but not big on watching it. Board games and video games are some things I enjoy, though I do not play too often. I am  pretty decent at ping-pong. I love playing and watching hockey. I am a huge fan of the Pittsburgh Penguins. I love dogs, and have two chocolate labs named Max and Sam.</p>
