		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Luke, I am currently attending Armstrong Jr. Sr. High School as a senior. I am maintaining distinguished honor roll and am taking a handful of Advanced Placement courses. I am the Senior Editor of the school's Yearbook Club, and am affiliated with the varsity soccer and hockey teams. I am looking to attend a four-year University for a computer science or a computer security degree.</p>
		<h2>My Interests</h2>
		<p>For starters, I really enjoy soccer. I very regularly attend scrimmages and pick-up matches with a bunch of people in my free time. I enjoy playing computer games, but not like an addiction. I also enjoy board games. I am a die-hard fan of the Pittsburgh Penguins. I have two chocolate labs named Max and Sam that I take care of.</p>
